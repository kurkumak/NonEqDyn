# NonEqDyn
THE_F_WAY,THE_Q_WAY are the directories that implement the scaling method, with respectively F the integrated response and Q the integrated C-shifted response (=0 in the equilibrium case)
brute_force is the directory where the three (R,F,Q) dynamics are implemented in a direct way, without any scaling
